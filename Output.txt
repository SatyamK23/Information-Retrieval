beetle
manthe
man
sat
in
a
niche
of
the
mountain
,
busily
hating
the
caribbean
sea
.it
was
quite
a
contract
that
he
had
undertaken
,
for
there
was
a
largeexpanse
of
caribbean
sea
in
sight
to
hate
;
very
blue
,
and
still
,and
indifferent
to
human
emotions
.
however
,
the
young
man
was
a
goodsteadfast
hater
,
and
he
came
there
every
day
to
sit
in
the
shade
of
theoverhanging
boulder
,
where
there
was
a
little
trickle
of
cool
air
downthe
slope
and
a
little
trickle
of
cool
water
from
a
crevice
beneath
therock
,
to
despise
that
placid
,
unimpressionable
ocean
and
all
its
worksand
to
wish
that
it
would
dry
up
forthwith
,
so
that
he
might
walk
backto
the
blessed
united
states
of
america
.
in
good
plain
american
,
theyoung
man
was
pretty
homesick
.two-man's-lengths
up
the
mountain
,
on
the
crest
of
the
sturdy
hater
'srock
,
the
girl
sat
,
loving
the
caribbean
sea
.
hers
,
also
,
was
a
largecontract
,
and
she
was
much
newer
to
it
than
was
the
man
to
his
,
for
shehad
only
just
discovered
this
vantage-ground
by
turning
accidentallyinto
a
side
trail
--
quite
a
private
little
side
trail
made
by
herunsuspected
neighbor
below
--
whence
one
emerges
from
a
sea
of
verdureinto
full
view
of
the
sea
of
azure
.
for
the
time
,
she
was
content
torest
there
in
the
flow
of
the
breeze
and
feast
her
eyes
on
that
broad
,unending
blue
which
blessedly
separated
her
from
the
united
states
ofamerica
and
certain
perplexities
and
complications
comprised
therein
.presently
she
would
resume
the
trail
and
return
to
the
city
of
caracuna
,somewhere
behind
her
.
that
is
,
she
would
if
she
could
find
it
,
whichwas
by
no
means
certain
.
not
that
she
greatly
cared
.
if
she
were
reallylost
,
they
'd
come
out
and
get
her
.
meantime
,
all
she
wished
was
torest
mind
and
body
in
the
contemplation
of
that
restful
plain
of
coolsapphire
,
four
thousand
feet
below
.but
there
was
a
spirit
of
mischief
abroad
upon
that
mountain
slope
.it
embodied
itself
in
a
puff
of
wind
that
stirred
gratefully
the
curlsabove
the
girl
's
brow
.
also
,
it
fanned
the
neck
of
the
watcher
below
andcunningly
moved
his
hat
from
his
side
;
not
more
than
a
few
feet
,
indeed
,but
still
far
enough
to
transfer
it
from
the
shade
into
the
glaring
sunand
into
the
view
of
the
girl
above
.
the
owner
made
no
move
.
if
the
windwanted
to
blow
his
new
panama
into
some
lower
treetop
,
compelling
him
tothrow
stones
,
perhaps
to
its
permanent
damage
,
in
order
to
dislodge
it
,why
,
that
was
just
one
more
cause
of
offense
to
pin
to
his
indictmentof
irritation
against
the
great
island
republic
of
caracuna
.
such
is
thetemper
one
gets
into
after
a
year
in
the
tropics
.like
as
peas
are
panama
hats
to
the
eyes
of
the
inexpert
;
far
more
likethan
men
who
live
under
them
.
for
the
girl
,
it
was
a
direct
inferencethat
this
was
a
hat
which
she
knew
intimately
;
which
,
indeed
,
she
hadrather
maliciously
eluded
,
riot
half
an
hour
before
.
therefore
,
sheaddressed
it
familiarly
:
``
boo
!
''the
result
of
this
simple
monosyllable
exceeded
her
fondestexpectations
.
there
was
a
sharp
exclamation
of
surprise
,
followed
by
acry
that
might
have
meant
dismay
or
wrath
or
both
,
as
something
metallictinkled
and
slid
,
presently
coming
to
a
stop
beside
the
hat
,
where
itrevealed
itself
as
a
pair
of
enormous
,
aluminum-mounted
brown-greenspectacles
.
after
it
,
on
all
fours
,
scrambled
the
owner
.shock
number
one
:
it
was
n't
the
man
at
all
!
instead
of
the
black-haired
,flanneled
,
slender
adonis
whom
the
trouble-maker
confidently
assumed
tohave
been
under
that
hat
,
she
beheld
a
brownish-clad
,
stocky
figure
witha
very
blond
head
.shock
number
two
:
the
figure
was
groping
lamentably
and
blindly
in
theundergrowth
,
and
when
,
for
an
instant
,
the
face
was
turned
half
towardher
,
she
saw
that
the
eyes
were
squinted
tight-closed
,
with
a
painfulextreme
of
muscular
tension
about
them
.presently
one
of
the
ranging
hands
encountered
the
spectacles
,
andsettled
upon
them
.
with
careful
touches
,
it
felt
them
all
over
.
a
mildgrunt
,
presumably
of
satisfaction
,
made
itself
heard
,
and
the
figuregot
to
its
feet
.
but
before
the
face
turned
again
,
the
girl
had
steppedback
,
out
of
range
.silence
,
above
and
below
;
a
silence
the
long
persistence
of
which
camenear
to
constituting
shock
number
three
.
what
sort
of
hermit
had
sheintruded
upon
?
into
what
manner
of
remote
brahministic
contemplation
hadshe
injected
that
impertinent
``
boo
!
''
?
who
,
what
,
how
,
why
--``
say
it
again
.
''
the
request
came
from
under
the
rock
.
evidently
thespectacled
owner
had
resumed
his
original
situation
.``
say
what
again
?
''
she
inquired
.``
anything
,
''
returned
the
voice
,
with
child-like
content
.``
oh
,
i
--
i
hope
you
did
n't
break
your
glasses
.
''``
no
;
you
did
n't
.
''on
consideration
,
she
decided
to
ignore
this
prompt
countering
of
thepronoun
.``
i
thought
you
were
some
one
else
,
''
she
observed
.``
well
,
so
i
am
,
am
i
not
?
''``
so
you
are
what
?
''``
some
one
else
than
you
thought
.
''``
why
,
yes
,
i
suppose
--
but
i
meant
some
one
else
besides
yourself
.
''``
i
only
wish
i
were
.
''``
why
?
''
she
asked
,
intrigued
by
the
fervid
inflection
of
the
wish
.``
because
then
i
'd
be
somewhere
else
than
in
this
infernal
hell-hole
of
ablack-and-tan
nursery
of
revolution
,
fever
,
and
trouble
!
''``
i
think
it
one
of
the
loveliest
spots
i
've
ever
seen
,
''
said
sheloftily
.``
how
long
have
you
been
here
?
''``
on
this
rock
?
perhaps
five
minutes
.
''``
not
on
the
rock
.
in
caracuna
?
''``
quite
a
long
time
.
nearly
a
fortnight
.
''the
commentary
on
this
was
so
indefinite
that
she
was
moved
toinquire
:
--``
is
that
a
local
dialect
you
're
speaking
?
''``
no
;
that
was
a
grunt
.
''``
i
do
n't
think
it
was
a
very
polite
grunt
,
even
as
grunts
go
.
''``
perhaps
not
.
i
'm
afraid
i
'm
out
of
the
habit
.
''``
of
grunting
?
you
seem
expert
enough
to
satisfy
--
''``
no
;
of
being
polite
.
i
'll
apologize
if
--
if
you
'll
only
go
on
talking
.
''she
laughed
aloud
.``
or
laughing
,
''
he
amended
promptly
.
``
do
it
again
.
''``
one
ca
n't
laugh
to
order
!
''
she
protested
;
``
or
even
talk
to
order
.
butwhy
do
you
stay
'way
out
here
in
the
mountains
if
you
're
so
eager
tohear
the
human
voice
?
''``
the
human
voice
be
--
choked
!
it
's
your
human
voice
i
want
to
hear
--
yourkind
of
human
voice
,
i
mean
.
''``
i
do
n't
know
that
my
kind
of
human
voice
is
particularly
different
fromplenty
of
other
human
voices
,
''
she
observed
,
with
an
effect
of
fineimpartial
judgment
.``
it
's
widely
different
from
the
kind
that
afflicts
the
suffering
ear
inthis
part
of
the
world
.
fourteen
months
ago
i
heard
the
last
americangirl
speak
the
last
american-girl
language
that
's
come
within
reachof
me
.
oh
,
no
,
--
there
was
one
,
since
,
but
she
rasped
like
a
rheumaticphonograph
and
had
brick-colored
freckles
.
have
you
got
brick-coloredfreckles
?
''``
stand
up
and
see
.
''``
no
,
sir
!
--
that
is
,
ma'am
.
too
much
risk
.
''``
risk
!
of
what
?
''``
freckles
.
i
do
n't
like
freckles
.
not
on
your
voice
,
anyway
.
''``
on
my
voice
?
are
you
--
''``
of
course
i
am
--
a
little
.
any
one
is
who
stays
down
here
more
than
ayear
.
but
that
about
the
voice
and
the
freckles
was
sane
enough
.
whati
'm
trying
to
say
--
and
you
might
know
it
without
a
diagram
--
is
that
,from
your
voice
,
you
ought
to
be
all
that
a
man
dreams
of
when
--
well
,when
he
has
n't
seen
a
real
american
girl
for
an
eternity
.
now
i
can
sithere
and
dream
of
you
as
the
loveliest
princess
that
ever
came
and
wentand
left
a
memory
of
gold
and
blue
in
the
heart
of
--
''``
i
'm
not
gold

blue
!
''``
of
course
you
're
not
.
but
your
speech
is
.
i
'll
be
wise
,
and
contentmyself
with
that
.
one
look
might
pull
down
,
in
irrevocable
ruin
,
all
thelovely
fabric
of
my
dream
.
by
the
way

are
you

.
no
,
of
course
you
're

no

would
be

to

.
the
question
is
:
how
did
you
get
here
?
''``
ah
,
that
's
my
secret
.
''``
or
,
rather
,
are
you
here
at
all
?
perhaps
you
're
just
a
figment
of
theoverstrained
ear
.
and
if
i
undertook
to
look
,
there
would
n't
be

at
all
.
''``
of
course
,
if
you
do

i
'll
fly
away
on

''``
oh
,
please
!
do

doing
my

''so
panic-stricken
was
the
appeal
that
she
laughed
again
,
in
spite
ofherself
.``
ah
,
that
's

now

almost
to

''``

she
replied
,
with
spirit
.``
is
it
plentiful
enough
so
that
you
could
spare

''``

she
queried

on

note
ofmirth

``

no

knot
them
together

''there
was
a
period
of
silence

it
's
very
difficult

complained
the
girl

because
you
're

again
the

in

was
real

came
the
thread

,
as
its
burden
rose
over

gave
a
little
cry
of
delight
:

from

free
her

over

his
attentive
ears
failed
to
discern
the
sound

whispered
in
the
tree-tops

a
sulphur-yellow
bird
,of
french
extraction

perched
in
a
flowering
bush

insistently
demanded

what

over

over
again

becoming
quite
wrathful
because
neither

any

else
offered
the
slightest
reply

explanation

the
girlsympathized
with
the
bird

if
the
particular
he
whose
blond
top
shecould
barely
see
by
peeping
over
the
rock
would
only
say
something

would
be
easier
for

but
he
did

so
presently
,
in
a
voiceof
suspiciously
saccharine
meekness
,
she
said
:

up

tree

bear

exhaled
from

was
instantly
panic-stricken

of
that
accent
which
sets
fire
to
bridges

beyond
hope
of

she
got
to
her
feet

perhaps
she
would
have
dared
and
gone
;perhaps
she
would
have
swallowed
pride

her
negative
,
and
made
onemore
appeal

she
turned
hesitantly

saw
the
devil

was
a
small
devil
on
stilts
,
not
more
than
three
or
four
inches
tall

there
was
no
mistaking
his
identity

no
other
living
thing
couldpossess
such
demoniac
little
red-hot
pin
points
of

be
sobristly
and
grisly

vicious

the
stilts
suddenly
folded
flat
,
and
thedevil
rushed
upon
his
prey
.
the
girl
stepped
back
;
her
foot
turned
andcaught
,
and
--``
of
course
,

the
patient
voice
below
was
saying
,

finally
collected

confirmed
his

suspicions

were
at
the

there
were
deep
lights
in
themthat
wholly
disordered

up

upon

annoyance

the

judged

superior

so
she
delivered

sundry
stinging
criticisms

stupidly
involved
itself

palled
upon

swiftly
along

at

half
an

accordingly
,
she
set
out
to

a
bite
to

for
a
time
,
missbrewster
followed
the
car
tracks
which
were
her
sure
guide
from

to
the
kast
;
briskly
enough
,
at

.
but
,
after

,
she
began
to
think
longingly
of
the
fourth
.
when
it
stoppedat
her
signal
,
it
was
well
filled
.
the
most
promising
ingress
appearedto
be
across
the
blockade
of
a
robust
and
much-begilded
young
man
,
whowas
occupying
the
familiar
position
of
an
``

hog

''
and
displayingthe
full
glories
of
the
hochwaldian

both
sleepy
and
cross
,
for
,
having
lingered
afterthe
reception
to
have
a
word
and
several
drinks
with
the
minister
offoreign
affairs
,
he
had
come
forth
to
find
neither
coach
nor
automobilein
attendance
.
there
had
been
nothing
for
it
but
the
plebeian
trolley
.accordingly
,
when
he
heard
a
foreign
voice
of
feminine
timbre
and
felta
light
pressure
against
his
knee
,
he
only
snorted
.
what
he
next
feltagainst
his

was
the
impact
of
a
half-shove
,
half-blow
,
brisk
enoughto
slue
him
around

the
intruder
passed
by
to
the
vacant
seat
,
while

thoroughly
awakened

annoyed

whirled
,
to
find
himselflooking
into
a
pair
of
expressionless
brown
goggles

a
snort
of
fury
,
the
diplomat
struck
backward
.
the
glasses
andthe
solemn
face
behind
them
dodged
smartly
.
the
next
moment
,
herr

felt
his
neck
encircled
by
a
clasp
none
the
less
warm
for

precisely
affectionate

he
was
pinned

twisting
,
he
worked
one
armloose

careful

cool
voice

dropped
off

darted
likea

around

into

in

hour
of

in

fraught
with
untoward
possibilities

indeed
,
itseemed
as
if
these
possibilities
might
promptly
become
actualities

the
diplomat
turned
his
stimulated
wrath

emphatic

''as
he
spoke
,
perkins
experienced
that
curious
feeling
that
someinvisible
person
was
trying
to
catch
his
eye
.
now
,
as
he
turned
directlyupon
carroll
,
his
glance
,
passing
over
his
shoulder
,
followed
a
broadray
of
light
spreading
from

leaf-framed
balcony

there
was
a
stir
amid
the
greenery
.
the
face

voiceappeared
,
framed
in
flowers
.
its
features
lighted
up
with
mirth
,
and
thelips
formed
the
unmistakable
monosyllable
:

identification
was
complete
--
''
boo
to

''``

unwittingly
he
spoke
the
name
aloud
,and
,
unfortunately
,
laughed
.to
a
less
sensitive
temperament
,
even
,
than
carroll
's
,
the
provocationwould
have
been
extreme
.
perkins
was
recalled
to
a
more
serious
view
ofthe
situation
by
the
choking
accents
of
that
gentleman
.``

off

held
the

aside

he
abruptly
satdown
on

the
bench

the

not
four

dropped
between

was
the
only

edged
backward

turned
to
secure
a
firm
hold
on
the
pavement

stepped
over
in

of
him

stood
nonplused

he
half
drewhis
hand
back

let
it
fall

distressfully

set

relaxed

true

observed
,
pleasantly
enough

drift
,

dreamy
consideration

she
wasnot
prone
lightly

this

shown
a
readiness

none

common

musing
upon

queerness

she
strolled
back

at

corner
of

in

heat
shelet

cream-colored
mule
choose
his

pace

so
they
proceeded
quiteslowly
up
the
hill
road
,
both
absorbed
in
meditation
,
which
ceased
onlywhen
the
mule
started
an
argument
about
a
turn
in
the
trail
.
he
was
awell-bred
trotting
mule
,
worth
six
hundred
dollars
in

of

he
was
self-appreciative

he
broughta
singular
firmness
of
purpose
to
the
support
of
the
negative
of
herproposition

was
that
he
should
swing
north

left

at

with
strict

up

so
i

my

listened

no

are
they

yes

perhaps
the

be
easier
toget
through

do
you

''in
truth
,
miss
polly
brewster
had
sustained
a
shock
.
she
had
becomeaccustomed
to
regard
her
beetle
man
rather
more
in
the
light
of
a
beetlethan
a
man
.
in
fact
,
the
human
side
of
him
had
impressed
her
only
asa
certain
dim
appeal
to
sympathy
;
the
masculine
side
had
simply
notexisted
.
now
it
was
as
if
he
had
unmasked
.
the
visage
,
so
grotesque
andgnomish
behind
its
mechanical
apparatus
,
had
given
place
to
a
whollydifferent
and
formidably
strange
face
.
the
change
all
centered
in
theeyes
.
they
were
wide-set
eyes
of
the
clearest
,
steadiest
,

darkestgray
she
had
ever
met
;
and
they
looked
out
at
her
from
sharply
angledbrows
with
a
singular
clarity
and
calmness
of
regard
.
in
their
light
theman
's
face
became
instinct
with
character
in
every
line

strength
wasthere
,
self-control
,
dignity
,
a
glint
of
humor
in
the
little
wrinkles
atthe
corner
of

mouth
,
and
,
withal
a
sort
of
quiet
and
sturdy
beauty
.she
had
half-turned
her
face
from
him
.
now
,
as
her
gaze
returned
andwas
fixed
by

,
she
felt
a
wave
of
blood
expand
her
heart
,
rush
upwardinto
her
cheeks
,
and
press
into
her
eyes
tears
of
swift
regret
.
butnow
she
was
sorry
,
not
for
him
,
but
for
herself
,
because
he
had
becomeremote
and
difficult

.``

how
could

she
remembered

ascended

a
rugged
climb

across
thedeep-fringed
chasm

plainly
see

porch

quinta

little
clearing

side

dim
in

clouded

fired
three
shots

contentedly

broke
from

down

no

told

she
sought
the
solution

a
woman
's
figure
emerged
from

porch

crossed
the
compound

dropped
upon

bench

even
at

,
the
watcher
could
tell
from
the
woman
's
bearing
and
apparelthat
she
was
not
of

seemed
to
be
gazing
out
overthe

dreary

forlorn

did

do

again

turned

saw
the
figure
in

groaned

caught
the
revolver
from
her

fired
three
slow
shots

turned

off
his
hat

he
signalled
violently
with
it

woman
rose
and

as

moved
in
humblesubmissiveness

consternation

the

it

gazed
about

read

bornewith
equanimity

miss
brewster
had
also
absented
herself
,
which
wasrather
too
much
for
the
devoted
,

apprehensive

lover

,
ampletime
was
given
him
to

he
was
shrewd
enough
to
draw
no
good
augury
from
that
.something
had
altered
her
,
and
he
was
divided
between
suspicion
of
thelast
week

mail
,
the
arrival
of
which
had
been
about
contemporaneouswith
her
change
of

was
a
letter
fromsmith

was
the
cause
nearer
at

one
preposterous
moment
he
thought
of
the
unspeakable
perk
.
a
quickvisualization
of
that
gnomish
,
froggish
face
was
enough
to
dispel
thesuspicion
.
at

the
petted
and
rather
fastidious
miss

would
be
captured
only
by
a

by

such
homunculusas
the

interest
,
perhaps
;
the
man
possessed
thebizarre
attraction
of
the
freakish
.
but
anything
else
was
absurd
.
andthe
knight
was
inclined
to
attaint
his
lady
for
a
certain
cruelty
in
thematter
;
she
was
being
something
less
than
fair
to
the
unspeakable

searchlight
of
his

upon

he
was
wearinga
pair
of
enormous
,
misfit
white
gloves

he
went
down
to
the
beggar
,reached
forth
a
hand
,
and
,
to
the
far-away
spectator
's
wonder-struckinterpretation
,
seemed
to
thrust
something
,
presumably
a
document
,
intothe
breast
of
the
mendicant

having
performed
this
strange
rite
,he
leaped
up
the
steps

hesitated
,
rushed
over
to
carroll

equipage
,and
laid
violent
hands
upon
the
occupant

with
obvious
intent
to
drawhim
forth

for
a
moment
they
seemed
to
struggle
upon

sidewalk

rushed
upon

unfortunate

to

him

him
bodily
into

turned
in

point

his
cue
in

opened
speech

arose

embraced
him
warmly

with
this

bearing
its

sped
around
the
corner

retired
to
obscurity

her
reeling

between

final
touch
of
phantasy

given
to
the

twohours

repelled
her

emphatic
gestures

a

half-strangledwords

unintelligibility

the

is
a

he
retorted
.
``
but
,
no
.
this
is
a
measure
of

thinks

what
's
the

''
asked
mr

.``
in
a
sense
it
has
.
it
would
probably
be
respected
by
a
mob
.
and
,
at
theworst
,
it
adjoins
the
british
legation
,
which
would
be
quite
safe
.
if
itwere
n't
that
sir

typhoid
,
you
'd
be
formally
invited
togo
there
.
''``
it
's
very
good
of
you

said
miss
polly
warmly
.
``
but
surely
it
would
bean
awful
nuisance

you

up

the
unspeakable

emerged
from

exploited
itself
in

swung

him

with

jerked
his
head
backward
toward
his
fare

eagerly
,
in

to

two

lifted
the
heavy
,
mumbling

carriedhim
up

a
rush

deposited
him
in
the
cab

was
still
angrily
expostulating

was
shivering
now
,and
the
cold
sweat
rolled
down
his

his
bearers
placed
themselveson

perkins
gave
an
order
to
the
driver

seemed
toobject
,
and
a
rapid-fire
argument
ensued
.``
what
's
wrong

asked
carroll

says
he

grimly

perkins
looked
up
from

disgusted

superciliously

he
did
not

approve
either
of
theunspeakable
perk

of
his
offhand
manners

they
had
gone
much
farther
,
his
resentment
was
heated
to
thepoint
of
offense

it
necessary
for
you
to
puff

second
thought
about
the
smoke
diverted
his
line
of
thought

he
asked

handed
him

and
thoughtfully
the
southerner
made
his
way
back
to
the
hotel
.after
dining
in
his
own
room
,
he
found
time
heavy
on
his
hands
;
so
,dispatching
a
note
of
excuse
to
miss

on
the
plea
of

,
he
slipped
out
into
the
city
.
wandering
idly
toward
the
hills
,he
presently
found
himself
in
a
familiar
street
,
and
,
impelled
by
humancuriosity
,
proceeded
to
turn
up
the
hill
and
stop
opposite
the
blankdoor
.here
he
was
puzzled
.
to
go
in
and
inquire
,
even
if
he
cared
to
andcould
make
himself
understood
,
would
perhaps
involve
further
risk
ofinfection
.
while
he
was
considering
,
the
door
slowly
opened
,
and
theleather-skinned
crone
appeared
.
her
eyes
were
swollen
.
in
her
hand
shecarried
a
travesty
of
a
wreath
,
done
in
whitish
metal
,
which
she
hadinterwoven
with
her
own
black
mantilla
,
the
best
substitute
for
crapeat
hand
.
this
she
undertook
to
hang
on
the
door
.
as
carroll
crossed
toaddress
her
,
a
powerful
,
sullen-faced
man
,
with
a
scarred
forehead
andthe
insignia
of
some
official
status
,
apparently
civic
,
on
his
coat
,emerged
from
a
doorway
and
addressed
her
harshly
.
she
raised
herreddened
eyes
to
him
and
seemed
to
be
pleading
for
permission
to
setup
the
little
tribute
to
her
dead
.
there
was
the
exchange
of
a
few
morewords
.
then
,
with
an
angry
exclamation
,
the
official
snatched
the
wreathfrom
her
.
carroll
's
hand
fell
on
his
shoulder
.
the
man
swung
and
saw
astranger
of
barely
half
his
bulk
,
who
addressed
him
in
what
seemed
to
bepolitely
remonstrant
tones
.
he
shook
himself
loose
and
threw
the
wreathin
the
crone
's
face
.
then
he
went
down
like
a
log
under
the
impact
of
aswinging
blow
behind
the
ear
.
with
a
roar
he
leaped
up
and
rushed
.
theforeigner
met
him
with
right
and
left
,
and
this
time
he
lay
still
.hanging
the
tragically
unsightly
wreath
on
the
door
,
through
which
theterrified
mourner
had
vanished

carroll
returned
to

began
to
edge
along

swinging
his

as

wondered
what
was
keeping

with

by

turning
,
he
darted
into

narrow
embrasure

he
was
comparatively
safe
from
the
missiles
that
were
now
comingfrom

,
with

shout
,
closed
in

.alone
on

balcony
,
the
girl
turned
her
head
away
and
cried
aloud
,hopelessly
,
for
help
.
she
wanted
to
close
her
ears
against
the
bestialshouts
of
a
mob
trampling
to
death
a
defenseless
man
,
but
her
arms
wereof
lead
.
she
listened
and
shivered
.instead
of
the
sound
that
she
dreaded
there
came
the
ringing
of
hoofson
stones
,
followed
by
yells
of
alarm
.
she
opened
her
eyes
to
see

bent
forward
in

the

tothe

urging
his
great
horse
down
upon
the
mass
of
people
asruthlessly
as

had
been
so
many

through
the
circle

,
swinging
his
mount
around
beside
the
shallow
doorway
beforewhich
three
caracunans
already
lay
sprawled
,
attesting
the
vigor
of
thedefender

final
resistance

back
of
the
horseman
lay
half
a

.
the
hochwaldian
jerked
out
his
sword
and
stood
,
a
splendidspectacle
.
very
possibly
he
was
not
wholly
unmindful
of
his
ownpictorial
quality
or
of
the
lovely
american
witness
thereto
.his
intervention
gave
a
few
seconds

respite

one
of
those
checksthat
save

make

now
,
in
the
further
making
of

,
sounded
a
lusty
whoop
from
the
opposite

a
battle
slogan
as
only
the
anglo-saxon
gives
.
it
emanated
fromgalpy

stillperspiring
from

a
highly
dissuasive

the
britons
swung
low
and
hard
forthe
ancient
right
of

breed
to
break
into
a
row
wherever
white
menare
in
the
minority
against

the
downhill
wing
of
the
mobbeing
much
the
weakest
,
opened
up
for
them
with
little
resistance
,leaving
them
a
free
path
to
the
cavalryman
,
to
whose
side
perkins
,
withstaff
ready
brandished
,
had
advanced
from
his
shelter
.``
wot
's
the
merry
game

''
inquired
the
cockney
cheerfully
.before
them
the
crowd
swayed
and
parted
,
and
there
appeared
,
lifted
bymany
arms
,
a
figure
with
a
dead-white
face
streaked
with
blood
,
runningfrom
a
great
gash
in
the
scalp
.``

went
down

explained
the
hochwald

there
rose
from
the

a
wailing
cry

quite
differentfrom

up

came

instantly

up

the

was
conscious

he
himself
seized

desperate

pinned
against

clubbing
his

toward

his

was
now
in

matters
looked
dark
indeed
,
when
there
shrilled
fiercely
fromabove
them
the
whirring
peal
of
a
silver
whistle
.polly
brewster
had
remembered

it
seemed
a

signal

she
ran
to
the

gazed
across
at
the

amicitia
,
she
sawall
its
windows
and
doors
tight
closed
,
as
befits
an
aristocratic
clubthat
has
no
concern
with
the
affairs
of
the
rabble
.
but
there
is
no
wayof
closing
a
patio
from
the
top
,
and
sounds
can
enter
readily
that
way
,when
all
other
apertures
are
shut
.
long
and
loud
miss
polly
blew
thesignal
on
the
silver
hunting-whistle
.in
the
club
patio
,
raimonda
was
chafing
and
wondering
,
and
a
scoreof
his
friends
were
drinking
and
waiting
.
that
signal
released
theiractivities
and
terminated
the
battle
of
the
american
legation
mostingloriously
for
the
forces
of
urgante
.
for
the
gilded
youth
of

,although
not
so
admittedly
as

furthermore
,
he
hasa
profound
contempt
for
the

class
;
a
contempt
extending
to
life

.
therefore
,
when
some
two
dozen
young
patricians
sallied
abruptlyforth
with
their
canes
,
and
the
mob
caught
sight
,
here
and
there
,
of
aglint
of
nickel
against

black
,
it
gave
back
promptly

some

rattled
against

there
were

a
few
,and
sundry
yells

broke

broken
and

performed
an
illegal
act

upon

day
notdesignated
as

she
raised
the
flag
ofan
alien

fixed
it
,

the
gilded
youth
of

in

cheered
,
not
the

would
have
been
unpatriotic

mr.

was
anxious

seen

on
the
pavement

whether
he
was
to

both

been
battered
and
bruised
,
though
it
was
nothing
,they
gleefully
averred
,
to
what
they
had
meted
out

had
anasty-looking

in

sat

had
little
difficulty
in
finding
thetrail
to
the
mountain

brilliant
new
moon
helped
to
make

ascent

what
course
he
would
pursue
upon

had
notclearly
defined

that
would
depend
largely
upon
the
attitudeof
the
man

was
seeking

the
flame
of
battle
,
still
hot
from

high
in

he
was
notof

whose
spirit
rapidly
cools

bitter
resentment
on

polly

fanned
that
flame
.
on
one
point
he
was
determined
:neither
he
nor
the
so-called
perkins
should
leave
the
mountain
until
hehad
had
from
the
latter
's
own
lips
a
full
explanation

out
into
the
open
space
,
he
got
his
first
glimpse
of
the
quinta

was
dark
,
except
for
one
low
light
.
from
the
farther
side
there
camefaintly
to
his
ear

rhythmical
sound
,
with
brief
intervals
of
quiet

some
one
hard
at
labor

stopping
from
time
to
time
for
breath
.at
that
distance
,
carroll
could
not
interpret
the
sound
,
but
someunidentified
quality
of
it
struck
chill
upon
his
fancy
.
long
experiencein
the
woods
had
made
him
a
good
trailsman
.
he
proceeded
cautiouslyuntil
he
reached
the
edge
of
the
clearing
.the
sound
had
stopped
now
,
but
he
thought
he
could
hear
heavy
breathingfrom
beyond
the
house
.
as
he
moved
toward
that
side
,
a
small
butmalevolent-looking
snake
slithered
out
from
beneath
a
bush
near
by
.involuntarily
he
leaped
aside
.
as
he
landed
,
a
round
pebble
slippedunder
his
foot
.
he
flung
up
his
arm
.
it
met
the
low
branch
of
a
tree
,and
saved
him
a
fall
.
but
the
thrashing
of
the
leaves
made
a
startlingnoise
in
the
moonlit
stillness
.
the
snake
went
on
about
its
business
.``
hola
!
''
challenged
a
voice
around
the
angle
of
the
house
.carroll
recognized
the
voice
.
he
stepped
out
of
the
shadows
and
strodeacross
the
open
space
.
at
the
corner
of
the
house
he
met
the
muzzle
ofa
revolver
pointing
straight
at
the
pit
of
his
stomach

back
of
it
werethe
steady
and
now
goggleless
eyes

lowered
his
weapon

carefully
whirledthe
cylinder
to
bring
the
hammer
opposite
an
empty
chamber
,
and
droppedit
in
his
pocket

``

an
explanation

quite
so

coolly

,half
an
hour
later

that
miss
polly
was
asleep
in
her
stateroom

andbegged
that

be
disturbed

was
utterly
worn
out

blame
her
for
her
silence

she
was

obeying
,

with
tearful
misgivings
,
dulyconstituted
authority
.eight
o'clock
struck
on
the
bell
of
the
little
protestant
mission
churchon
the
tiny
plaza
;
struck
and
was
welcomed
by
the
echoes
,
and
passedalong
to
eventual
silence
.
within
two
minutes
after
,
there
was
a
specialstir
and
movement
on
the
pier
,
a
corresponding
stir
and
movement
onboard
the
trim
craft
,
a
swishing
of
great
ropes
,
and
a
tooting
ofwhistles
.
white
foam
churned
astern
of
her
.
a
comic-supplement-lookingpelican
on
a
buoy
off
to
port
flapped
her
a
fantastic
farewell
.
theblockade-defying
yacht
polly
was
off
for
blue
waters
and
the
freedom
ofthe
seas
.on
the
shore
,
feeling
woefully
helpless
and
alone
,
she
who
had
beenthe
jewel
and
joy
of
the
polly
bit
her
lips
and
closed
her
eyes
,
in
atremulous
struggle
against
the
dismal
fear
:
--``
suppose
he
does
n't
love
me
,
after

''xivthe
yellow
flagthe
departing
whistle
of
the
yacht
polly
struck
sharply
to
the
heart
ofa
desolate
figure
seated
on
a
bench
in
the
blazing
,
dusty
,
public
squareof
puerto
del
norte
,
waiting
out
his
first
day
of
pain
.
a
kiskadee
bird
,the
only
other
creature
foolish
enough
to
risk
the
hot
bleakness
of
theplaza
at
that
hour
,
flitted
into
a
dust-coated
palm
,
inspected
him
,
puta
tentative
query
or
two
,
decided
that
he
was
of
no
possible
interest
,and
left
the
unspeakable
perk
to
his
own
cogitations
.so
deep
in
wretchedness
were
the
cogitations
that
he
did
not
hearthe
light
,
hesitant
footstep

but
he
felt
in
every
vein
and
fiber
theappealing
touch
on
his
shoulder
.``
good
god
!
what
are
you

?

he
cried
,
leaping
to
hisfeet
.
there
was
no
awkwardness
or
shyness
in
his
speech
now
;
onlywonder-stricken
joy
.``

stamped

``

he
agreed
thoughtfully
